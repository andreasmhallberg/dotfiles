In its brief expanse, he sketches out a number of ideas whose implications have yet to be coherently developed, whether related to {Arabic} or to any speech community. In this article I will critically examine some of these ideas and methods and compare them to my own research project on the representation of Arabic East and West, which is directly related to it and is actually an outgrowth of it.

@article{belnap_arabic_2003,
  abstract = {During the past two decades a good deal of research has focused on intermediate forms of spoken {Arabic}; little attention, however, has been paid to the mixing found in the everyday prose of modern Arabs. This paper explores aspects of the use of {Arabic} dialectal elements that are regularly used and more formal structures that are regularly avoided in informal personal correspondence. It is based on interviews conducted primarily with Jordanians, Palestinians, Egyptians, and Moroccans, as well as the analysis of samples of written correspondence. This paper examines some of the factors that underlie an apparent trend to use dialectal Arabic in an increasing number of domains formerly considered the domain of "standard" Arabic. Key factors include the spread of basic literacy among the masses as well as contact with Western rhetorical models styles. Particular discussion is devoted to the role of language at attitudes.

It offered not only an admittedly idealized characterization of diglossia in {Arabic}, but also pointed out how and why it might change. Focusing on Tunisia, this article demonstrates the many ways in which Fergie was right. It examines the changing demographics of Tunisians' access to the high variety of {Arabic}; the complex ways in which Tunisians, and Arabs more generally, deal with the "communicative tensions" diglossia creates; and considers the changing nature of Arabic in what is, in many ways, a postdiglossic Tunisia.

@article{parkinson_verbal_2003,
  abstract = {This paper is a study of the verb forms that appeared in a set of oral interviews conducted in Standard {Arabic} in Cairo, {Egypt}. Although the ,speakers were clearly attempting to produce Standard Arabic, there is much mixing of colloquial. Instead of the somewhat more typical approach of characterizing a whole form as either Standard or colloquial, this paper takes a detailed look at all the elements that go into such a judgment: the presence of ending vowels on the forms, word order, the form of accompanying negative particles, the form of the passive, and a number of phonological features of the verb: the prefix vowel, the stem vowel, infix vowels, the addition of particles like bi- and sa-, and the presence of feminine plural forms. The statistics on these features show that although use of Standard forms increases with increases in level of education and formality of the situation (making them all potent markers of formality and self-identity) in addition to other social factors, it would not be accurate to say that they co-vary. They all have quite distinct patterns that are hard to characterize other than statistically. It is argued that attempts to characterize the Standard colloquial continuum functionally have not been completely successful, and other ways of characterizing the continuum are called for.

@article{hawkins_diglossia_1983,
  abstract = {Ferguson's classic description and definition of diglossia was later extended by Gumperz and Fishman to other multi-lingual and multi-dialectal situations which are in some ways similar. However, all these accounts are based on uses of the two codes (the `High' and `Low' varieties) rather than on the linguistic relationships between the codes themselves. When the latter form the basis of the definition, `true' diglossia of the Greek or {Arabic} kind can be distinguished from multi-lingual, standard-nonstandard dialect, and possibly Creole, situations by certain critical differences. In true diglossia, the L is a natively-spoken, relatively independent variety for which descriptive grammars have been (or can be) written, while H is not a single form but varies indefinitely and its description can best be derived from L by `purification' rules (a `bottom-up' description). This is the mirror-image of a dialect situation, where usually it is the H which is a natively-spoken, independent variety, and L exists in no `pure' form but is indefinitely variable, its description proceeding from a basis of the standard (a `top-down' description).

This `process' model of diglossia has advantages over the traditional `static' model in accounting for the multiplicity of intermediate or `mixed' varieties which arise, and which are ultimately more significant than `pure' H or `pure' L.

In an investigation of Modern Greek diglossia, thirty subjects, 15 relatively `educated' and 15 `uneducated', were tested by a version of Cloze procedure to assess competence in the use of H. All speakers, even the educated ones, were found to use H inconsistently, with frequent switching to L forms.},

  abstract = {Previous research on {Arabic} heritage speakers points to notable variability in the language proficiencies of Arabic heritage speakers, both as individuals and as groups (Albirini \& Benmamoun, 2012; Albirini, Benmamoun, \& Saadah, 2011). This study examines the language proficiencies of Egyptian and Palestinian heritage speakers, assesses the relationship between their L1 proficiency levels and other linguistic, socio-affective, socio-contextual, and demographic factors, and explores the relative significance of these factors in determining proficiency in heritage Arabic. A total of 20 Egyptian and 20 Palestinian heritage speakers completed an oral narrative that was used for assessing three dimensions of their language proficiencies, namely fluency, grammatical accuracy, and syntactic complexity. In addition, the participants filled in a 182-item questionnaire about the factors potentially influencing their heritage language skills, including language input, language use, language attitudes, ethnic identity, family role, community support, school, and demographics. The study also involved follow-up interviews with a sample of five Palestinian and five Egyptian participants.
The results showed that the Palestinian speakers outperformed their Egyptian counterparts in terms of language fluency, accuracy, complexity, and overall proficiency. Pearson and Spearman correlations indicated that language use, language input, family role, community support, and parents' language correlate positively with language proficiency. Multiple regression analyses showed that language use (in terms of frequency, range, and contexts) is the only significant predictor of the variability in heritage language proficiency. Lastly, the interviews revealed that the Palestinian heritage speakers' linguistic advantage over their Egyptian counterparts might be attributed to their commitment to {Arabic} as a main marker of their heritage and identity, the encouragement of their families to maintain their heritage language, and the wider social networks to which they had access. The implications of the study are discussed.},

Several frameworks for viewing cultural variations were used to develop a chart on ``cultural communication preference'' for Americans and Arabs. For the Arab culture, emphasis is on form over function, affect over accuracy, and image over meaning. An awareness of these cultural differences can help American practitioners deal more effectively with their Arab clients in developing written and oral communication, in public relations programming and in understanding professional ethics.},

  abstract = {In the United Kingdom, the relationship between social and regional dialects and accents in such that the smallest amount of regional variations is found at the top of the social scale and the largest at the bottom. Social differences in language are smallest in the south of England, since both the Standard English dialects and the Received Pronunciation ({RP}) accent are southern in origin. Regional differences are not generally large enough to cause comprehension problems. Educationally, we have to recognise that all dialects are potentially equally adequate and that the main problem is one of unfavourable attitudes to low-status varieties. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR}]

@article{dussias_when_2013,
  abstract = {In a recent study, Lew-Williams and Fernald (2007) showed that native Spanish speakers use grammatical gender
  information encoded in Spanish articles to facilitate the processing of upcoming
  nouns. In this article, we report the results of a study investigating whether
  grammatical gender facilitates noun recognition during second language (L2)
  processing. Sixteen monolingual Spanish participants (control group) and 18
  English-speaking learners of Spanish (evenly divided into high and low Spanish
  proficiency) saw two-picture visual scenes in which items matched or did not
  match in gender. Participants' eye movements were recorded while they
  listened to 28 sentences in which masculine and feminine target items were
  preceded by an article that agreed in gender with the two pictures or agreed
  only with one of the pictures. An additional group of 15 Italian learners of
  Spanish was tested to examine whether the presence of gender in the first
  language (L1) modulates the degree to which gender is used during L2 processing.
  Data were analyzed by comparing the proportion of eye fixations on the objects
  in each condition. Monolingual Spanish speakers looked sooner at the referent on
  different-gender trials than on same-gender trials, replicating results reported
  in past literature. Italian-Spanish bilinguals exhibited a gender anticipatory
  effect, but only for the feminine condition. For the masculine condition,
  participants waited to hear the noun before identifying the referent. Like the
  Spanish monolinguals, the highly proficient English-Spanish speakers showed
  evidence of using gender information during online processing, whereas the less
  proficient learners did not. The results suggest that both proficiency in the L2
  and similarities between the L1 and the L2 modulate the usefulness of
  morphosyntactic information during speech processing.},

@article{schiffman_standardization_1998,
  abstract = {{ABSTRACT}
  The Tamil language has had its current standard written form since the 13th century; but because of increasing diglossia, spoken Tamil dialects have now diverged so radically from earlier norms, including the written standard ({LT}, or Literary Tamil) that no spoken dialect, regional or social, can function as the koiné or lingua franca. Because {LT} is never used for authentic informal oral communication between live speakers, there has always been a need for some sort of spoken ``standard'' koiné for inter-dialect communication. Aside from interpersonal communication, one hears this inter-dialect koiné most clearly in the so-called ``social''film, which arose out of its antecedent, the popular or ``social'' drama. Conversational portions of novels and short stories also exhibit spoken forms, though not always as clearly ``phonetic'' as a phonetician might expect. The goal of this paper is to examine the concept of ``language standardization'' as it has been applied to other languages, focusing on the role of literacy and writing in this process; then to present evidence for, as well as the sources of, koinæization of "Standard Spoken Tamil"; and then to determine whether {SST} is in fact an emergent standard, given the challenges of literacy and writing. (Standardization, Tamil, diglossia, linguae francae, koinés)},

@article{humphreys_independent_1985,
  abstract = {Abstract
  One of the most popular and influential theories of word processing, dual-route theory, proposes that there are two functionally independent means of processing words, one involving access to lexical knowledge and the other involving nonlexical grapheme-to-phoneme conversion. Three topics germane to this theory are the processing of nonwords, spelling regularity effects, and the manner in which reading may be impaired following selective damage to either route. This paper evaluates evidence on these topics, and in each case the claims of the theory for an independent nonlexical processing route are called into question. This conclusion is further supported by a discussion of the linguistic constraints that limit any nonlexical grapheme---phoneme conversion process. Some alternative approaches to visual word processing, which share the assumption that lexical knowledge can guide the assembly of phonological information, are discussed. It is argued that these approaches should direct future research.},

  abstract = {This presentation will begin by detailing the features of Arabic that make what might be called normal corpus manipulation problematic. It will then review ongoing attempts to resolve these problems (i.e. to provide Arabic corpora that can ``do what English corpora can do''). A case will then be made for the need for a very large, non-lemmatized corpus of Arabic until such time as the massive resources needed to create a large lemmatized corpus become available in a non-politicized/non-ideological manner. {arabiCorpus}.byu.edu is one attempt to provide this clearly less than adequate, temporary solution.

An overview of {arabiCorpus} will be given that will highlight both what it does well and what it does poorly. The nuts and bolts behind the `magic' will be explained, and then several case studies will be examined which will demonstrate that although this corpus clearly cannot `do' what English corpora routinely do, creative solutions exist that allow one in many cases to approximate those results, and which provide data for uses in lexicography, Arabic language teaching and Arabic Linguistics that would have been difficult or impossible to obtain before the availability of such online corpora.},

@article{azmi_survey_2015,
  abstract = {Abstract
  In Modern Standard Arabic texts are typically written without diacritical markings. The diacritics are important to clarify the sense and meaning of words. Lack of these markings may lead to ambiguity even for the natives. Often the natives successfully disambiguate the meaning through the context; however, many Arabic applications, such as machine translation, text-to-speech, and information retrieval, are vulnerable due to lack of diacritics. The process of automatically restoring diacritical marks is called diacritization or diacritic restoration. In this paper we discuss the properties of the Arabic language and the issues that are related to the lack of the diacritical marking. It will be followed by a survey of the recent algorithms that were developed to solve the diacritization problem. We also look into the future trend for researchers working in this area.},
