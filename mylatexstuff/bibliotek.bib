@article{mughazy_reading_2005,
	abstract = {This paper investigates the effects of the vowel marking (or the lack thereof) on the reading strategies used by adult educated native speakers, and how these strategies can enhance the reading skills of learners of Arabic as foreign language. Twenty-four college-educated native speakers were engaged in a context reconstruction task to test their ability to disambiguate homographs in three conditions: when the script included accurate vowel diacritics, when the diacritics were misleading, and when they were omitted. The results demonstrate that proficient readers of Arabic employ top-down strategies more frequently and efficiently than bottom-up strategies. In other words, they do not make significant use of vowel marking when made available. Rather, they rely on their knowledge of the content, morpho-phonemic patterns, and intuitions about the statistical probabilities of word order to disambiguate homographs. These patterns suggest that learners of Arabic need context based strategy instruction rather than reliance on text driven bottom-up strategies that can hinder their development as readers.},

@article{haugen_dialect_1966,
	abstract = {The impossibility of stating precisely how many ``languages'' or ``dialects'' are spoken in the world is due to the ambiguities of meaning present in these terms, which is shown to stem from the original use of ``dialect'' to refer to the literary dialects of ancient Greece. In most usages the term ``language'' is superordinate to ``dialed,'' but the nature of this relationship may be either linguistic or social, the latter problem falling in the province of sociolinguistics. It is shown how the development of a vernacular, popularly called a dialect, into a language is intimately related to the development of writing and the growth of nationalism. This process is shown to involve the selection, codification, acceptance, and elaboration of a linguistic norm.},

@article{biggs_enhancing_1996,
	abstract = {Two lines of thinking are becoming increasingly important in higher educational practice. The first derives from constructivist learning theory, and the second from the instructional design literature. Constructivism comprises a family of theories but all have in common the centrality of the learner's activities in creating meaning. These and related ideas have important implications for teaching and assessment. Instructional designers for their part have emphasised alignment between the objectives of a course or unit and the targets for assessing student performance. ``Constructive alignment'' represents a marriage of the two thrusts, constructivism being used as a framework to guide decision-making at all stages in instructional design: in deriving curriculum objectives in terms of performances that represent a suitably high cognitive level, in deciding teaching/learning activities judged to elicit those performances, and to assess and summatively report student performance. The ``performances of understanding'' nominated in the objectives are thus used to systematically align the teaching methods and the assessment. The process is illustrated with reference to a professional development unit in educational psychology for teachers, but the model may be generalized to most units or programs in higher education.},

	abstract = {Abstract While the defining cases of diglossia offered in Charles Ferguson's 1959 article have long been useful as vehicles for introducing this important form of societal multilingualism, they are also problematic in that they differ from each other in a number of significant ways. This article proposes a modified and more precise framework in which a distinction is made between three sub-categories of diglossia. The first, `traditional diglossia' consists of diglossia in pre-modern societies where a sacred language serves as H for an entire civilisation, and it is proposed that Classical Chinese, Sanskrit, Latin and Classical {Arabic} be viewed as prototypes of this category. This category is closer to Ferguson's original description, and should be viewed as the most typical manifestation of diglossia. A second category, `revived diglossia', includes cases in which ancient languages were revived by communities in colonial contexts for the purpose of buttressing incipient nationalism. A third and much smaller category, `modern diglossia' is made up of cases of speech communities in modern societies where a modern standard language functions as the H variety. Distinguishing between these sub-categories will allow scholars to make stronger and more precise generalisations about diglossia.},

Two groups (46 participants), proficient and less proficient, of nonnative readers of {Arabic} read an expository text, wrote an immediate recall protocol in their first language to measure their overall reading comprehension, and completed a vocabulary task and an icraab task. Whereas the analysis of the data revealed that vocabulary knowledge had a significant main effect, icraab was found not to have a significant role in reading comprehension. Although the issue of icraab needs further investigation, the results suggest that reading comprehension is independent of a knowledge of icraab and depends mainly on vocabulary knowledge.},

@article{sanni_discourse_2010,
	abstract = {The {Arabic} terminological tradition is remarkably unique for the application of a single referential word to a variety of concepts across subjects. One such term is la{\d h}n, which, in the sense of a terminus technicus, became a familiar topos in philological, jurisprudential, literary, and Qur'{\=a}nic discourses. The present study re-examines the referential terrain of the term, taking as its point of departure, Johann F{\"u}ck's (d. 1974) seminal discussion of it. An entirely new area to which the term came to be applied relates to the aesthetic genres; namely, the poetic and prose forms where particular manipulation of meanings or expressions became interpretable as rhetorical la{\d h}n. From Ibn Durayd (d. 321/933) down to Ibn Rash{\=\i}q (d. 456/1063), this study examines the trajectory of the evolution and formalization of the term la{\d h}n in the context of allusive tropes established by theorists and literary legislators. The study also demonstrates that, its strong referential attachment to incorrect idiom notwithstanding, the application of the term la{\d h}n to other phenomena in the scholarly discourse was all the more remarkable in regard to the literary, theoretical tradition where the elasticity of the terminological convention is once more established.},

@article{randel_effectiveness_1992,
	abstract = {This article reviews the literature that compares the instructional effectiveness of games to conventional classroom instruction. Studies dealing with empirical research rather than teachers'judgments are reviewed. Published reviews of research in English dating from 1963 to 1984 were examined and the literature was searched for studies from 1984 to 1991. Of the 67 studies considered over a period of 28 years, 38 show no difference between games and conventional instruction; 22 favor games; 5 favor games, but their controls are questionable; and 3 favor conventional instruction. Results for social sciences, math, language arts, logic physics, biology, retention over time, and interest are examined. Math is the subject area with the greatest percentage of results favoring games, but only eight studies have adequate controls. Thirty-three out of 46 social science games/simulations show no difference between games/simulations and classroom instruction. The authors conclude that subject matter areas where very specific content can be targeted are more likely to show beneficial effects for gaming.},

@article{belnap_arabic_2003,
	abstract = {During the past two decades a good deal of research has focused on intermediate forms of spoken {Arabic}; little attention, however, has been paid to the mixing found in the everyday prose of modern Arabs. This paper explores aspects of the use of {Arabic} dialectal elements that are regularly used and more formal structures that are regularly avoided in informal personal correspondence. It is based on interviews conducted primarily with Jordanians, Palestinians, Egyptians, and Moroccans, as well as the analysis of samples of written correspondence. This paper examines some of the factors that underlie an apparent trend to use dialectal Arabic in an increasing number of domains formerly considered the domain of "standard" Arabic. Key factors include the spread of basic literacy among the masses as well as contact with Western rhetorical models styles. Particular discussion is devoted to the role of language at attitudes.

@article{lennon_investigating_1990,
	abstract = {This paper investigates various easily quantifiable performance features that might function as objective indicators of oral fluency. It would be advantageous if we could assemble a set of variables that functioned as good indicators of what expert judges, such as experienced native-speaker {EFL} teachers, are reacting to when subjectively assessing fluency. This would advance our knowledge of what constitutes fluency and especially what makes for perceived fluency differences among learners and how an individual learner improves in fluency over time. To these ends a sample of the spoken performance of four advanced {EFL} learners was recorded at the start of six-months' residence in Britain and again shortly before departure. A panel of 10 native-speaker teachers of {EFL} subjectively rated the recordings for global fluency and generally agreed that the second set was more fluent than was the first, though for each subject one or two panel members dissented. A battery of 12 readily quantifiable performance variables considered to be related to fluency was then assembled. Values per subject per recording were obtained, expressed as frequency rates or as proportions so that comparisons could be made between first and second renderings. For each variable, subjects' scores were compared between the two time points to ascertain in which features improvements were consistently manifested. For each variable t-tests were conducted between sample means at Week 2 and Week 23. Improvement of note at the 0.05 level of significance was found for three variables (one-tailed test), namely, speech rate, filled pauses per T-Unit, and percentage of T-Units followed by pause. Surprisingly, self-corrections did not prove a good indicator. The implications of the study are that quantitative analysis can indeed help to identify fluency improvements in individual learners, and may have the potential to provide objective assessment of spoken fluency. Findings revealed two key areas of performance that seem to be important for fluency: (1) speech-pause relationships in performance and (2) frequency of occurrence of dysfluency markers such as filled pauses and repetitions (but not necessarily self-corrections). However, even from this small-scale study it does seem that there is scope for individual variation among subjects in the precise areas in which fluency improvements may occur. Further research might be able to identify both ``core'' and ``peripheral'' fluency variables. Quantitative analysis has applications both as a testing instrument and as a diagnostic tool to identify individual learner strengths and weaknesses among the components of fluency. Investigation of native-speaker performance might provide native-like target score ranges on each variable for learners to aim at.},

It offered not only an admittedly idealized characterization of diglossia in {Arabic}, but also pointed out how and why it might change. Focusing on Tunisia, this article demonstrates the many ways in which Fergie was right. It examines the changing demographics of Tunisians' access to the high variety of {Arabic}; the complex ways in which Tunisians, and Arabs more generally, deal with the "communicative tensions" diglossia creates; and considers the changing nature of Arabic in what is, in many ways, a postdiglossic Tunisia.

Pan-Arab television operates on an ideology and profit logic of transnational Arab ethnolinguistic unity. However, entertainment programming does not utilize Modern Standard {Arabic} ({MSA}) as the interactional norm, despite state linguistic regimes. Instead, entertainment media has discursively constructed Mashreqi (eastern) Arabic as unmarked media Arabic. I argue that changes in talent program participation tactics are widening corporate media inclusion and legibility of non-``core'' Arabics (such as Tunisian, Fessi, Emirati, non-standard social registers) in recognition of changing market sensibilities.},

@article{abdulaziz_factors_1986,
	abstract = {This article discusses the factors involved in the modernization of the {Arabic} language in {Egypt} and the Middle East. Modernization of the Arabic language in {Egypt} got its impetus through the modernization policies of Mohamed Ali, who encouraged young Egyptians to go to Europe to study scientific and technical subjects. When the students returned home, they were in the vanguard of the modernization movement and a Western cultural style of living, which contributed to the trend for the modernization of the Arabic language. In 1812 Arabic was declared the national language of Egypt. On the assumption that major changes in language structure and use reflect closely what goes on elsewhere in the sociocultural, literary, intellectual, educational and psychological life of society, it follows that these various factors impinge upon the modernization process in general and language use and development in particular. In Lebanon, modernizing influences started early in the 19th century because of Arab-Christian ties to European churches and the much greater presence of Europeans. The first Arabic press is said to have been introduced by a Maronite scholar in the 17 century. In the 19th and 20th centuries, Lebanon was in the vanguard of the enlightenment movement, with its modern press producing all kinds of modern Arabic literary and scientific materials and specialized dictionaries.},

It investigated the switch from Classical {Arabic} to Egyptian Arabic in the religious domain in one of the most renowned preachers in {Egypt}, Amr Khaled. In order to investigate the phenomenon, I chose to examine and analyze the instances of codeswitching from Classical Arabic to Egyptian Arabic in ten recordings of religious speeches delivered by Khaled, focusing on the phonological, syntactical, and morphological features. In addition, the study examined the possibility of a relationship between the frequency of switches and the kind of audience (Egyptians vs. non-Egyptians), and the type of discourse (lecture vs. discussion session). This study attempted also to measure the attitudes and perceptions of educated Egyptians towards the use of Egyptian Arabic in religious discourse in order to explore perception of language change from Classical to Egyptian Arabic in religious domain. This was carried out by means of two data collection methods: (1) a questionnaire and (2) interviews that were conducted in three states of Egypt; Cairo, Menoufiyya, and North Sinai which represent urban, rural, and Bedouin dialects respectively.},

The purpose of the present book is to provide an introduction to this grammatical tradition not merely by summarizing it, but by putting it into a perspective that will make it accessible to any linguist trained in the western tradition. The reader should not by put off by the word 'medieval': Arabic grammatical theory shares a number of fundamental similarities with modern linguistic theory. Indeed, one might argue that one reason Arabic theory has gone unappreciated for so long is that nothing like it existed in the West at the time of its 'discovery' by Europeans in the 19th century, when the European orientalist tradition was formed, and that it it only with the development of a Saussurean and Bloomfieldian structural tradition that a better perspective has become possible.},

Three texts of each kind were presented in three reading conditions: correctly vowelized, unvowelized and wrongly vowelized. Results indicated that vowels had a significant effect on reading accuracy of poor and skilled readers in reading each of the four kinds of texts. The results are discussed in light of the concept that more cross-cultural considerations should be made in reading theory today.},

The examination leads to the hypothesis that different cognitive strategies are required to achieve reading efficiency in various writing systems. Issues connected with this hypothesis have been examined by cognitive psychologists, anthropologists, and neurolinguists. Those issues having to do particularly with bilingual literacy are reviewed: (1) reading disability incidence in syllabic and logographic systems compared with alphabetic systems, (2) neuropsychological research, (3) differential processing mechanisms and behavior consequences, (4) the process in reading of recoding the visual},

	abstract = {The use of international broadcasting, a tool of public diplomacy since World War I, can be divided into two chronological periods. The first, which began during World War I and declined in the post--Cold War era, was characterized by international government-sponsored radio broadcasters. The second began with the emergence of privately owned global news networks (e.g., {CNN}, Sky News, and {MSNBC}) in the 1980s and 1990s, which were deemed more credible than government-sponsored stations. Based on an 8-year study of Al-Jazeera's coverage of Saudi affairs throughout the Qatari--Saudi conflict, which revealed a strong correlation between Al-Jazeera {Arabic}'s tone toward Saudi affairs and the development of the Qatari--Saudi conflict, the article argues that Qatar invented a new model of public diplomacy by operating Al-Jazeera as a hybrid state-sponsored/private network, effectively transforming the network into a highly potent public diplomacy tool. Accordingly, the article discusses the interplay among news networks, ownership, and use of public diplomacy tactics in contemporary international broadcasting.},

	abstract = {The noun plural system in Modern Standard {Arabic} lies at a nexus of critical issues in morphological learnability. The suffixing ``sound'' plural competes with as many as 31 non-concatenative ``broken'' plural patterns. Our computational analysis of singular--plural pairs in the Corpus of Contemporary Arabic explores what types of linguistic information are statistically relevant to morphological generalisation for this highly complex system. We show that an analogical approach with the generalised context model is highly successful in predicting the plural form for any given singular form. This model proves to be robust to variation, as evidenced by its stability across 10 rounds of cross-validation. The predictive power is carried almost entirely by the {CV} template, a representation which specifies a segment's status as a consonant or vowel only, providing further support for the abstraction of prosodic templates in the Arabic morphological system as proposed by {McCarthy} and Prince.},

@article{parkinson_verbal_2003,
	abstract = {This paper is a study of the verb forms that appeared in a set of oral interviews conducted in Standard {Arabic} in Cairo, {Egypt}. Although the ,speakers were clearly attempting to produce Standard Arabic, there is much mixing of colloquial. Instead of the somewhat more typical approach of characterizing a whole form as either Standard or colloquial, this paper takes a detailed look at all the elements that go into such a judgment: the presence of ending vowels on the forms, word order, the form of accompanying negative particles, the form of the passive, and a number of phonological features of the verb: the prefix vowel, the stem vowel, infix vowels, the addition of particles like bi- and sa-, and the presence of feminine plural forms. The statistics on these features show that although use of Standard forms increases with increases in level of education and formality of the situation (making them all potent markers of formality and self-identity) in addition to other social factors, it would not be accurate to say that they co-vary. They all have quite distinct patterns that are hard to characterize other than statistically. It is argued that attempts to characterize the Standard colloquial continuum functionally have not been completely successful, and other ways of characterizing the continuum are called for.

To be regarded as communication, nonverbal behavior should be intentional and goal-directed, but it need not involve a conscious choice by the speaker. Recently, many scholars have emphasized both the importance of nonverbal behavior in the communicative event and the complexity of communicative signals, both verbal and nonverbal. Nonverbal signals are multifunctional, augment verbal signals in unique ways, and are intricately combined with verbal signals in communication. In impromptu speech, both verbal and nonverbal choices made by the speaker are spontaneous, not planned as they might be, to some extent, in non-impromptu speech. In general, the importance of the nonverbal channel depends on the function of the discourse, which also determines the communication style. More},

Inferences are drawn from five detailed case studies, taken from a wider sample of university students who completed an hourly diary for one week. A subsample was also interviewed. Perceptions of workload are not synonymous with time spent studying, but can be weakly influenced by them. There are both class effects from contextual variables and individual differences within a class. Perceptions of workload are influenced by content, difficulty, type of assessment, teacher--student and student--student relationships. Workload and surface approaches to learning are interrelated, in what appears to be a complex reciprocal relationship. It is possible to inspire students to work long hours towards high quality learning outcomes if attention is paid to teaching approaches, assessment and curriculum design in the broadest sense. It is, therefore, important to have open evaluation systems which gather feedback on a wide array of curriculum variables.},

However, all these accounts are based on uses of the two codes (the `High' and `Low' varieties) rather than on the linguistic relationships between the codes themselves. When the latter form the basis of the definition, `true' diglossia of the Greek or {Arabic} kind can be distinguished from multi-lingual, standard-nonstandard dialect, and possibly Creole, situations by certain critical differences. In true diglossia, the L is a natively-spoken, relatively independent variety for which descriptive grammars have been (or can be) written, while H is not a single form but varies indefinitely and its description can best be derived from L by `purification' rules (a `bottom-up' description). This is the mirror-image of a dialect situation, where usually it is the H which is a natively-spoken, independent variety, and L exists in no `pure' form but is indefinitely variable, its description proceeding from a basis of the standard (a `top-down' description).

This `process' model of diglossia has advantages over the traditional `static' model in accounting for the multiplicity of intermediate or `mixed' varieties which arise, and which are ultimately more significant than `pure' H or `pure' L.

In an investigation of Modern Greek diglossia, thirty subjects, 15 relatively `educated' and 15 `uneducated', were tested by a version of Cloze procedure to assess competence in the use of H. All speakers, even the educated ones, were found to use H inconsistently, with frequent switching to L forms.},

I. Introduction The politicizing of language that took place in {Egypt} before and after the January 25th revolution provides a rich environment for linguistic analysis on many levels. It is no exaggeration to say that discussion of language always feeds into politics through identity construction. As Paul Gee contends, language is in essence political: Politics is not just about contending political parties. At a much deeper level it is about how to distribute social goods in a society: who gets what in terms of money, status, power, and acceptance on a variety of{\ldots}},

	abstract = {The study examined two questions: (1) do the greater phonological awareness skills of billinguals affect reading performance; (2) to what extent do the orthographic characteristics of a language influence reading performance and how does this interact with the effects of phonological awareness. We estimated phonological metalinguistic abilities and reading measures in three groups of first graders: monolingual Hebrew speakers, bilingual Russian--Hebrew speakers, and {Arabic}-speaking children. We found that language experience affects phonological awareness, as both Russian--Hebrew bilinguals and the Arabic speakers achieved higher scores on metalinguistic tests than Hebrew speakers. Orthography affected reading measures and their correlation with phonological abilitites. Children reading Hebrew showed better text reading ability and significant correlations between phonological awareness and reading scores. Children reading Arabic showed a slight advantage in single word and nonword reading over the two Hebrew reading groups, and very weak relationships between phonological abilities and reading performance. We conclude that native Arabic speakers have more difficulty in processing Arabic orthography than Hebrew monolinguals and bilinguals have in processing Hebrew orthography, and suggest that this is due to the additional visual complexity of Arabic orthography.},

Related issues with respect to eye movements during scene perception and visual search are also reviewed. It is argued that research on eye movements during reading has been somewhat advanced over research on eye movements in scene perception and visual search and that some of the paradigms developed to study reading should be more widely adopted in the study of scene perception and visual search. Research dealing with ``real-world'' tasks and research utilizing the visual-world paradigm are also briefly discussed.},

This paper combines linguistic analysis, a survey, and interviews to examine English and {Arabic} language use in online communications by a group of young professionals in {Egypt}. The study indicates that, among this group, English is used overwhelmingly in Web use and in formal e-mail communication, but that a Romanized version of Egyptian Arabic is used extensively in informal e-mail messages and online chats. This online use of English and Arabic is analyzed in relation to broader social trends of language, technology, globalization, and identity.},

This trend has important consequences in education, not only for speakers of languages other than English, but also for speakers of minority varieties of English. In this article, assimilationist ideology is rejected as a way of legitimizing the educational experience of language minority groups. Instead, a pluralist position is adopted, one that views the teaching of standard English as a second dialect ({SESD}) as ``additive bidialectalism'' rather than remediation. The terms dialect, creole, and standard are discussed with reference to the harmful effects of linguistic prescriptivism. Research in two areas is then reviewed: (a) studies examining differences in varieties and their influence on communication and (b) sociolinguistic work on classroom participation structures involving language minority students. It is concluded that differences in varieties are not trivial and that culturally appropriate modifications to classroom discourse patterns, such as those implemented in a program for Hawaii Creole English-speaking children, are useful models for other {SESD} settings.},

The two groups of students were compared and their temporal and linguistic measures were correlated with the fluency scores they received from three experienced native and three non-native speaker teacher judges. The teachers' written comments concerning the students' performance were also taken into consideration. For all the native and non-native teachers, speech rate, the mean length of utterance, phonation time ratio and the number of stressed words produced per minute were the best predictors of fluency scores. However, the raters differed as regards how much importance they attributed to accuracy, lexical diversity and the mean length of pauses. The number of filled and unfilled pauses and other disfluency phenomena were not found to influence perceptions of fluency.},

They get themselves learned and learned well, so that they get played long and hard by a great many people. This is how they and their designers survive and perpetuate themselves. If a game cannot be learned and even mastered at a certain level, it won't get played by enough people, and the company that makes it will go broke. Good learning in games is a capitalist-driven Darwinian process of selection of the fittest. Of course, game designers could have solved their learning problems by making games shorter and easier, by dumbing them down, so to speak. But most gamers don't want short and easy games. Thus, designers face and largely solve an intriguing educational dilemma, one also faced by schools and workplaces: how to get people, often young people, to learn and master something that is long and challenging--and enjoy it, to boot.},

Specific obstacles posed by contemporary Arabic diglossia to the acquisition of literacy are discussed, including the attitudes of parents and teachers to the colloquial and standard forms of Arabic. Some remedies are suggested. These include modification of the Arabic script, and improving the status of Arabic as a language of instruction in the schools, where it is often replaced by English or French. Above all, the paper emphasises the necessity to expose young children to literary Arabic, by means such as story reading to preschoolers, so that it is not, in effect, another language that they have to learn as soon as they enter school.},

However, Prunet, B{\'e}land, and Idrissi (2000) present Arabic aphasic evidence supporting the lexical (morphemic) status of the consonantal root for Arabic. In this article we offer supporting evidence from Arabic hypocoristics for the morphemic status of the consonantal root.

However, little of this research has focused on social psychological aspects such as attitudes and self-reports associated with codeswitching. In our first study, attitudes about codeswitching were gathered from 169 Tunisian University students using a matched-guise technique. In the second study, 28 similar students completed language diaries that reported details about their use of different language varieties over several days. In the third study, employing a field experimental approach, the extent of actual codeswitching behaviour was observed in casual interactions with over 700 individuals in the streets. Results revealed that negative evaluations of codeswitching obtained in the first study were not reflected in the behavioural data obtained in the subsequent studies that examined self-reported and actual behaviour. Moreover, {CS} was employed largely with `ingroup' members (e.g. friends, family and other Tunisians), but less with teachers or members of non-Arab groups. Although the latter findings are discussed in terms of ethnolinguistic identity processes, the overall findings of the three studies demonstrate that {CS} is a distinct linguistic variety, which could serve to bridge the linguistic {Arabic}-French duality of post-colonial Tunisia.},

Interviews are analysed as functionally specialized forms of interaction (cf. Heritage, 1985) with various functions in different phases of the news production. We assume that interviews are organized and carried out as communicative activities oriented towards specific tasks, identities and contexts of interaction. In contrast to established definitions of the archetypical on-air news interview, we argue that broadcast interviewing is only partially produced for an ``overhearing audience'' (Heritage, 1985). Taking into account the entire process of producing and presenting news, journalism harbours a multitude of interviewing practices and activities which remain invisible if only the taped and transcribed broadcast talk is analysed. Our study clearly indicates that news interviews contain more diversified and hybrid activities of communication than have been described in previous research.},

At a more specific level, differences in study behaviour have been described in terms of approaches to learning, and regulation and processing strategies. The paper clarifies the meaning of the various concepts, highlights the interrelationships between them, and considers the ways in which they may affect students' reactions to the learning environments they experience, whether powerful or not.},

@article{rast_towards_2003,
	abstract = {This paper attempts to shed light on the question of what in the input is perceived and processed by the learner, and how it is processed upon first contact with a target language. Subjects were French learners of Polish who had had no contact with Polish or any other Slavic language before the onset of the project. They were tested on a sentence repetition task before receiving any Polish instruction, after 4 hours of instruction, and again after 8 hours. The results suggest that even as little as 8 hours of exposure induces a recognizable interlanguage; that the influence of global input can be predicted by word length, word stress, phonemic distance, transparency, position and frequency; and that the role these factors play evolves over time. Together the results suggest a way to characterise the notion of saliency in the input.},

The volume reflects the central themes of Ramzi Baalbaki s scholarly work: history of {Arabic} grammar, Arabic lexicography, Arabic linguistics, comparative Semitics, Arabic epigraphy, and textual editing of classical texts. It provides intellectual, literary, and social historians, as well as Arabists, philologists, and linguists with an interesting glimpse into the early medieval and modern traditions related to the Arabic language, its grammar, historical development, and demonstrates its centrality to other fields of study such as Qur nic studies, adab, folk literature, sufism, and poetry.Contributors include: Nadia Anghelescu, Georgine Ayoub, Aziz Azmeh, Monique Bernards, Georges Bohas, Gerhard B{\"o}wering, Michael Carter, Everhard Ditters, Geert Jan van Gelder, Hassan Hamz{\'e}, Peter Heath, Pierre Larcher, Ibrahim Ben Mrad, Bilal Orfali, Wad d al-Q , Angelika Neuwirth, Karin Ryding, Yasir Suleiman, Kees Versteegh, and David Wilmsen},

In the context of Arab patriarchy, it is argued that each gender's preference for code choice can be explained by social and cultural norms that impose differential entitlements to the public sphere.

This paper, in contrast, draws attention to the hierarchies among the regional varieties of vernacular Arabic. Specifically, it makes visible the workings of what it calls the `Maghreb-Mashreq language ideology': the hierarchical relationship between Mashreqi (Middle Eastern) and Maghrebi (North African) vernacular Arabic varieties. The paper explores, in particular, the de/authentication of linguistic Arabness through a detailed analysis of a transnational pan-Arab reality/talent {TV} show. Drawing on clips of situated interactions from this series, which have been uploaded to {YouTube} and commented upon by viewers, the paper argues that the new media is a critical site for reworking longstanding language ideologies and the politics of identity in the Arabic-speaking world.[Arabic]},

	abstract = {The salient issues facing contemporary {Arabic} morphological analysis are summarized as predominantly orthographic in nature, although the issue of how to integrate morphological analysis of the dialects into the existing morphological analysis of Modern Standard Arabic is identified as the primary challenge of the next decade. Issues of orthography that impact morphological analysis stem in part from the successful deployment of the Unicode standard and the subsequent increase in usage of the expanded Arabic character set, including what are properly Persian and Urdu characters. Additional orthographic issues impacting morphological analysis arise from the persistent and widespread variation in the spelling of letters such as hamza and t{\=a}' {marb{\=u}Ta}, and the increasing lack of differentiation between word-final y{\=a}' and alif {maqS{\=u}ra}. The tokenization of Arabic input strings is also affected by orthography, as typists often neglect to insert a space after words that end with a non-connector letter. An increasing number of archaic morphological features and dated lexical items can be observed in Web-based Islamic publications and cannot be overlooked in contemporary analysis. Finally, the accuracy and completeness of current Arabic morphological analysis can be questioned in light of the almost complete absence of annotation for lexically-determined features of gender, number, and humanness},

Analyzing {ASCII}-ized Arabic ({AA}) can give insights into ways in which {CMC} is shaped by linguistic, technological and social factors. This paper presents a study of {AA} as used among female university students in the United Arab Emirates, drawing on data from a small corpus of instant messenger ({IM}) conversations, and from an e-mail survey of users' experience with this form of writing. The {AA} in the conversations was found to show influences from computer character sets, from different varieties of spoken Arabic, from Arabic script, from English orthography and from other latinized forms of Arabic used in contexts which pre-date {CMC}. Users have developed creative (but variable) solutions to the constraints involved, but the purposes of {AA} use also extend for social reasons to situations where technical constraints do not apply.},

@article{chambers_what_1997,
	abstract = {Fluency is a commonly used notion in foreign language teaching, frequently contrasted with accuracy especially in a communicative language teaching. In ordinary life it often has an extended meaning and is used as a synonym of overall oral proficiency. On the contrary, in the assessment of foreign language proficiency, it is one of several descriptors of oral performance. Despite the belief that we share a common definition as language teachers and researchers, there is some evidence that agreement cannot be taken for granted and various interpretations coexist. The purpose of this paper is to review recent research into the qualitative and quantitative aspects of fluency in order to arrive at a clearer definition of the word, both as a performance descriptor for oral assessment of foreign language learners and as an indicator of progress in language learning. It is suggested that research into temporal variables in speech production provides concrete evidence which can contribute to a more precise definition of fluency. However a purely quantitative definition of fluency does not enable us to discover how to facilitate efficient processes of speech productions. A qualitative, linguistic analysis of the language produced by advanced language learners reveals some of the links between linguistic knowledge and performance skills.},

This study examines the language proficiencies of Egyptian and Palestinian heritage speakers, assesses the relationship between their L1 proficiency levels and other linguistic, socio-affective, socio-contextual, and demographic factors, and explores the relative significance of these factors in determining proficiency in heritage Arabic. A total of 20 Egyptian and 20 Palestinian heritage speakers completed an oral narrative that was used for assessing three dimensions of their language proficiencies, namely fluency, grammatical accuracy, and syntactic complexity. In addition, the participants filled in a 182-item questionnaire about the factors potentially influencing their heritage language skills, including language input, language use, language attitudes, ethnic identity, family role, community support, school, and demographics. The study also involved follow-up interviews with a sample of five Palestinian and five Egyptian participants.
The results showed that the Palestinian speakers outperformed their Egyptian counterparts in terms of language fluency, accuracy, complexity, and overall proficiency. Pearson and Spearman correlations indicated that language use, language input, family role, community support, and parents' language correlate positively with language proficiency. Multiple regression analyses showed that language use (in terms of frequency, range, and contexts) is the only significant predictor of the variability in heritage language proficiency. Lastly, the interviews revealed that the Palestinian heritage speakers' linguistic advantage over their Egyptian counterparts might be attributed to their commitment to {Arabic} as a main marker of their heritage and identity, the encouragement of their families to maintain their heritage language, and the wider social networks to which they had access. The implications of the study are discussed.},

The study provides three examples of different forms of Egyptian public discourse related directly to identity that took place during the 2011 revolution of {Egypt}, a time when state {TV} media stations cast doubt on the identity of the protestors by utilizing linguistic resources. This article argues that during the process of stance-taking speakers employ linguistic resources, discourse resources and structural resources. These linguistic resources include the associations and indexes of different languages and varieties, in this case Standard {Arabic} ({SA}), Egyptian Colloquial Arabic ({ECA}) and English. This stance-taking process depends on code-switching as a mechanism that lays claims to different indexes and thus appeals to different ideologies and different facets of identity. Second, this study also shows how speakers use public discourse in order to construe language as a classification category and an identity builder.},

Several frameworks for viewing cultural variations were used to develop a chart on ``cultural communication preference'' for Americans and Arabs. For the Arab culture, emphasis is on form over function, affect over accuracy, and image over meaning. An awareness of these cultural differences can help American practitioners deal more effectively with their Arab clients in developing written and oral communication, in public relations programming and in understanding professional ethics.},

In face of so much regional and stylistic variation, the urge to koineize Arabic speech under the powerful influences, emotive and other, of nationalism, mass education and urbanization is in large measure served by the controlling power of the written language. It is the interplay between written Arabic and vernacular Arabic that creates and maintains Educated Spoken Arabic ({ESA}), both nationally and internationally. The label Modern Standard Arabic ({MSA}) is commonly applied to the written language of contemporary literature, journalism, television and radio news broadcasts, scientific and technological writing, administration and diplomacy. The lexicogrammatical regularities of {ESA}, national or international, are not those of {MSA}. Thus, no gender distinctions are made in {ESA} in the 2nd and 3rd persons plural and a non-{MSA} type of gender distinction is made in the 2nd person singular. The famous High versus Low dichotomy of the classic formulation of so-called diglossia is one such rather coarsely meshed net which provides no adequate basis for a grammatical description of {ESA}.},

This focus can be sketched by surveying a number of its component conceptual approaches, such as anthropological linguistics, ethnography of communication, variationist sociolinguistics, and the sociology and politics of languages. Its consideration of language as a total cultural fact is outlined by reference to studies that differentially emphasize language structure, entextualization/contextualization of language, and language ideology.},

This dissertation sets out to determine the effect of the complexity of word formation on the legibility of Arabic and the role that vocalization plays in reading. This is carried out via a holistic approach to legibility research that combines the visual culture with eye movement in reading and legibility studies. To do this it looks at the transition of Arabic manuscript letterforms into typographic ones, the anatomy of the Arabic script, and the predominant typographic styles in use today. It presents the design process of the specially designed Afandem typeface family, a review of eye movement findings, and a new definition of legibility that is rooted in the models of eye movement. The experiment used eye tracking to test 72 subjects in Beirut to determine the effect of the complexity and vocalization on reading measures. The results show that the increased complexity of word formation has a negative effect on the legibility of Arabic typefaces and that the short vowels add a cost to word processing even though they bring with them extra clarity that results in a reduced number of regressions. These results are discussed within the scope of the Arab world today, its cultural and educational setup, and avenues for further research are explored.},

@thesis{hallberg_case_2016,
	abstract = {Morphologically marked case is a salient Standard Arabic feature without parallel in Arabic dialects. As such it is a grammatical system learned by native speakers of Arabic through formal education. Case endings are traditionally regarded as an essential feature of Standard Arabic, but morphological case endings are used only sporadically in extemporaneous speech in formal situations where Standard Arabic is the expected variety. This study investigates how case endings that are used in speech are distributed in relation to morphosyntactic parameters with the aim of finding covert linguistic norms governing where case is and is not marked in speech. This is done by a quantitative analysis of a corpus consisting of 17 televised interviews of highly educated native speakers of Arabic. Only speech by the interviewees was analyzed, totaling 35 000 words or 5 h and 22 min. Nouns and adjectives in the corpus are annotated for morphosyntactic features, including if and how the case ending is produced. The data show that the rate of case marking differs widely between speakers, but also that there are patterns, consistent between speakers, of how case endings are proportionally distributed in various morphosyntactic contexts. It was found that case endings are very rarely used in words with the definite article al-, in adjectival attributes, and on words at the end of utterances. Case marking is strongly favored on words where it would be orthographically represented in writing and on words with an enclitic pronoun. It was also found that these patterns are not the result of speakers relying on a set of fixed phrases to include case endings in their speech. The findings presented in this study have important implications for Arabic curriculum development, both in first and second language teaching, and also shed light on the role of the use of case endings in Arabic diglossia.},

@article{jordan_reading_2013,
	abstract = {In English and other alphabetic languages read from left to right, useful information acquired during each fixational pause is generally reported to extend much further to the right of each fixation than to the left. However, the asymmetry of the perceptual span for alphabetic languages read in the opposite direction (i.e., from right to left) has received very little attention in empirical research. Accordingly, we investigated the perceptual span for Arabic, which is one of the world's most widely read languages and is read from right to left, using a gaze-contingent window paradigm in which a region of text was displayed normally around each point of fixation, while text outside this region was obscured. Skilled Arabic readers who were bilingual in Arabic and English read Arabic and English sentences while a window of normal text extended symmetrically 0.5o to the left and right of fixation or asymmetrically, by increasing this window to 1.5o or 2.5o to either the left or the right. When English was read, performance across window conditions was superior when windows extended rightward. However, when Arabic was read, performance was superior when windows extended leftward and was essentially the reverse of that observed for English. These findings show for the first time that a leftward asymmetry in the central perceptual span occurs when Arabic is read and, for the first time in over 30 years, provide a new indication that the perceptual span for alphabetic languages is modified by the overall direction of reading.},

@article{jordan_evaluating_2011,
	abstract = {Some studies have claimed that, when fixating a word, a precise split in foveal processing produces substantial effects on word recognition because all letters to the left and right of fixation project to different, contralateral hemispheres. Recently in this Journal, Jordan, Paterson, Kurtev, and Xu (2010, Cortex, 46, 298--309) evaluated this claim using precisely-controlled procedures of fixation and stimulus presentation and found no evidence of split-foveal processing. However, in line with other research in this area, these findings were obtained using a Latinate alphabetic language (in this case English) which may induce specific effects on performance. Consequently, here we report a further study which used stimuli from a fundamentally different, non-Latinate alphabetic language (Arabic) with characteristics better suited to revealing effects of split-foveal processing, if they exist. Participants made lexical decisions to five-letter Arabic words (and nonwords) when fixations were made immediately to the right (location 1) or left (location 6) of each stimulus, or at one of the four possible inter-letter locations (locations 2--5). Fixation location was carefully controlled using an eye-tracker linked to a fixation-contingent display and all stimuli were presented within foveal vision to avoid confounding influences of extrafoveal projections. Performance was equally poorest when fixating locations 1 and 6 (i.e., when words were shown entirely to either the left or right of fixation), equally intermediate for locations 2 and 5, and equally superior for locations 3 and 4 (i.e., the centre of words). Moreover, additional, word-specific analyses showed no evidence of the effects of fixation location on individual word recognition also predicted by split-foveal processing. These findings from a non-Latinate language complement those reported previously for English to provide further evidence that while fixation location influences word recognition, these influences occur with no functional division in hemispheric processing at the point of fixation.},

The results revealed a significant effect forvowels and for context across all reading conditions in Arabic {andHebrew}. The surprising result was that the vowelized texts in Arabic andthe pointed and unpointed texts in Hebrew were comprehendedsignificantly better. Further, Pearson correlation procedures andmultiple regression analysis indicated no positive significantrelationship between oral reading accuracy results and silent readingcomprehension results.

@article{hermena_processing_2015,
	abstract = {Diacritics convey vowel sounds in Arabic, allowing accurate word pronunciation. Mostly, modern Arabic is printed nondiacritized. Otherwise, diacritics appear either only on homographic words when not disambiguated by surrounding text or on all words as in religious or educational texts. In an eye-tracking experiment, we examined sentence processing in the absence of diacritics and when diacritics were presented in either modes. Heterophonic homographic target verbs that have different pronunciations in active and passive (e.g., /daraba/, hit; /doriba/, was hit) were embedded in temporarily ambiguous sentences in which in the absence of diacritics, readers cannot be certain whether the verb was active or passive. Passive sentences were disambiguated by an extra word (e.g., /bijad/, by the hand of). Our results show that readers benefitted from the disambiguating diacritics when present only on the homographic verb. When disambiguating diacritics were absent, Arabic readers followed their parsing preference for active verb analysis, and garden path effects were observed. When reading fully diacritized sentences, readers incurred only a small cost, likely due to increased visual crowding, but did not extensively process the (mostly superfluous) diacritics, thus resulting in a lack of benefit from the disambiguating diacritics on the passive verb.},

@article{jaeger_categorical_2008,
	abstract = {This paper identifies several serious problems with the widespread use of {ANOVAs} for the analysis of categorical outcome variables such as forced-choice variables, question-answer accuracy, choice in production (e.g. in syntactic priming research), et cetera. I show that even after applying the arcsine-square-root transformation to proportional data, {ANOVA} can yield spurious results. I discuss conceptual issues underlying these problems and alternatives provided by modern statistics. Specifically, I introduce ordinary logit models (i.e. logistic regression), which are well-suited to analyze categorical data and offer many advantages over {ANOVA}. Unfortunately, ordinary logit models do not include random effect modeling. To address this issue, I describe mixed logit models (Generalized Linear Mixed Models for binomially distributed outcomes, Breslow and Clayton [Breslow, N. E. \&amp; Clayton, D. G. (1993). Approximate inference in generalized linear mixed models. Journal of the American Statistical Society 88(421), 9--25]), which combine the advantages of ordinary logit models with the ability to account for random subject and item effects in one step of analysis. Throughout the paper, I use a psycholinguistic data set to compare the different statistical methods.},

Thirty-five heritage speakers (19 elementary and 16 advanced), 28 advanced L2 learners, and 16 native-speaker controls completed five negation tasks. The results indicated that, whereas elementary heritage speakers entered the MSA classroom with an advantage over their L2 counterparts in the area under study, the advanced heritage speakers exhibited patterns that were comparable to those of the L2 learners. Unlike their L2 counterparts, however, the advanced heritage speakers displayed positive and negative transfer effects from colloquial Arabic. The findings are discussed in the framework of three models/hypotheses of first language transfer to a third language, and their pedagogical implications for Arabic language teaching and learning are explicated.},

This paper examines Arabic heritage speakers' knowledge of subject--verb agreement versus noun--adjective agreement with the aim of contrasting their distributions and exploring areas of resilience and vulnerability within Arabic heritage speech and their theoretical implications. Two oral-production experiments were carried out, one involving two picture-description tasks, and another requiring an elicited narrative. The results of the study show that subject--verb agreement morphology is more maintained than noun--adjective morphology. Moreover, the unmarked singular masculine default is more robust than the other categories in both domains and is often over-generalized to other marked categories. The results thus confirm the existence of these asymmetries. We propose that these asymmetries may not be explained by a single factor, but by a complex set of morphological, syntactic, semantic, and frequency-related factors.},

	abstract = {An increasing trend in many postsecondary foreign language classes in North America is the presence of heritage language learners. Heritage language learners are speakers of ethnolinguistically minority languages who were exposed to the language in the family since childhood and as adults wish to learn, relearn, or improve their current level of linguistic proficiency in their family language. This article discusses the development of the linguistic and grammatical knowledge of heritage language speakers from childhood to adulthood and the conditions under which language learning does or does not occur. Placing heritage language acquisition within current and viable cognitive and linguistic theories of acquisition, I discuss what most recent basic research has so far uncovered about heritage speakers of different languages and their language learning process. I conclude with directions for future research. [{PUBLICATION} {ABSTRACT}]},

Features of diachronic change and children's acquisition are briefly treated.

@article{davies_contrastive_1987,
	abstract = {This paper is concerned with the kinds of formulaic expression used by speakers of a language as markers of politeness, a knowledge of which is indispensable to the acquisition of communicative competence in the language. They can present many pitfalls for the learner who is not fully aware of their conditions of use; a failure to grasp the often subtle differences between first-language and target-language formulas can lead to serious misunderstandings and misjudgements. It is argued here that an explicitly contrastive discussion of formulas in the two languages can be helpful both in improving the learner's productive and receptive performance and in developing a deeper understanding of the foreign culture. A framework for the analysis and comparison of politeness formulas is presented, and examples taken from English and Moroccan Arabic are used to illustrate the kinds of contrast that may arise and the difficulties these may pose for the learner.},

Located in Middle Egypt near Al-Minya, residents of Sheik Mubarak speak in a dialect closer to Sa'eedi, not the dialect spoken in Cairo. Omar spent time there conducting interviews, examinations, and taping sessions with children and families to study primary language acquisition in non-Western languages. Based on her fieldwork, Omar describes the physical and social environment in which the native language was learned, the development of early communication and speech, and when and how children learn the phonology, vocabulary, morphology, and syntactical patterns of Egyptian Arabic. Omar makes comparisons with aspects of language acquisition of other languages, primarily English, and explores implications for the theory of language acquisition. Originally published in 1973, this book is the most thorough and complete analysis of the stages in which children learn Arabic as a first language. The Arabic in this book is presented in transcription, making the information accessible to all linguists interested in language acquisition.},

@article{deutsch_syntactic_2001,
	abstract = {The interrelation between syntactic analysis of agreement and semantic processing was examined by recording eye movements and event-related potentials. Subject-predicate gender agreement was manipulated within Hebrew sentences. The subject was either animate or inanimate, with conceptual gender denoted by the subject's morphological structure. First-pass reading time was found to be longer for incongruent predicates than of congruent predicates but only if the predicate's gender was morphologically marked. Furthermore, this effect was larger in the animate than in the inanimate condition. Second-pass reading time was also prolonged by gender incongruity but this effect was not affected by either markedness or animacy. Gender incongruity enhanced the amplitude of an early negative potential (ostensibly {ELAN}), of a later negative potential (N400), and of a positive potential (P600). Like first-pass reading time, the congruity effect on the syntactically modulated P600 was significant only for marked predicates, but it did not interact with animacy. In contrast, the congruity effect on the semantically modulated N400 was significant only in the animate condition. The N400 was not affected by markedness. The congruity effect on the early negativity did not interact with either animacy or markedness. The interaction between semantic and syntactic processing and its time course are discussed within the framework set by interactive, constraint-based models for online sentence processing.},

This anomaly signals to the parser that an error has occurred, and provides cues for how to repair it. Anomaly detection is thus an important aspect of sentence processing. In the present study, we investigated how the parser responds to unambiguous sentences that contain syntactic anomalies and pragmatic anomalies, examining records of eye movement during reading. While sensitivity to the two kinds of anomaly was very rapid and essentially simultaneous, qualitative differences existed in the patterns of first-pass reading times and eye regressions. The results are compatible with the proposal that syntactic information and pragmatic information are used differently in garden-path recovery.},

@article{braze_readers_2002,
	abstract = {Evidence is presented that eye-movement patterns during reading distinguish costs associated with the syntactic processing of sentences from costs associated with relating sentence meaning to real world probabilities. Participants (N = 30) read matching sets of sentences that differed by a single word, making the sentence syntactically anomalous (but understandable), pragmatically anomalous, or non-anomalous. Syntactic and pragmatic anomaly each caused perturbations in eye movements. Subsequent to the anomaly, the patterns diverged. Syntactic anomaly generated many regressions initially, with rapid return to baseline. Pragmatic anomaly resulted in lengthened reading times, followed by a gradual increase in regressions that reached a maximum at the end of the sentence. Evidence of rapid sensitivity to pragmatic information supports the use of timing data in resolving the debate over the autonomy of linguistic processing. The divergent patterns of eye movements support indications from neurocognitive studies of a principled distinction between syntactic and pragmatic processing procedures within the language processing mechanism.},

	abstract = {Readers' eye movements were monitored as they read sentences describing events in which an individual performed an action with an implement. The noun phrase arguments of the verbs in the sentences were such that when thematic assignment occurred at the critical target word, the sentence was plausible (likely theme), implausible (unlikely theme), or anomalous (an inappropriate theme). Whereas the target word in the anomalous condition provided evidence of immediate disruption, the effect of the target word in the implausible condition was considerably delayed. The results thus indicate that when a word is anomalous, it has an immediate effect on eye movements, but that the effect of implausibility is not as immediate},

	abstract = {The present experiment investigated the influence of 5 intercorrelated variables on word recognition using a multiple regression analysis. The 5 variables were word frequency, subjective familiarity, word length, concreteness, and age of acquisition ({AoA}). Target words were embedded in sentences and eye tracking methodology was used to investigate the predictive power of these variables. All 5 variables were found to influence reading time. However, the time course of these variables differed. Both word frequency and familiarity showed an early but lasting influence on eye fixation durations. Word length only significantly predicted fixation durations after refixations on the target words were taken into account. This is the 1st experiment to demonstrate concreteness and {AoA} effects on eye fixations. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2016 {APA}, all rights reserved) (Source: journal abstract)},

@article{juhasz_role_2006,
	abstract = {Over the past several decades, many researchers have examined how a word's age of acquisition ({AoA}) contributes to word recognition. Most of these studies, however, have used word-in-isolation experiments. At the same time, many studies have utilized eye tracking techniques to investigate the word frequency effect during reading. The present experiments sought to tie these two types of research together by investigating the influence of {AoA} and frequency on word processing. Specifically, eye movements were recorded as participants read sentences. The first experiment orthogonally manipulated frequency and {AoA}. In Experiment 2, participants read sentences that contained target words that varied in {AoA} but were controlled on various measures of word frequency. The same participants also read sentences containing high and low frequency words that were controlled on {AoA}. Results from these two experiments converged to demonstrate that both frequency and {AoA} affect eye fixation durations during sentence reading.},

@article{vermunt_metacognitive_1996,
	abstract = {This paper addresses the following questions: how do students perform metacognitive, cognitive and affective learning functions; how is the execution of learning functions regulated by internal and external sources; what learning styles can be discerned from the viewpoint of learning functions and regulation? Subjects were students from an open distance university and a regular university. They were interviewed extensively about their learning strategies, mental models of learning, learning orientations and interpretations and appraisals of instructional measures. The interviews were analyzed in a phenomenographic way. The results indicate that there are large differences among students in the manner in which they carry out learning functions, that these differences are associated with internal and external sources, and that four qualitatively different learning styles can be discerned: an undirected, a reproduction directed, a meaning directed and an application directed learning style. Mental models of learning and learning orientations turn out to be related to the way in which students interpret, appraise and use instructional measures to regulate their learning activities. It is concluded that in many instances instructional measures do not have the intended effects. Suggestions are given regarding the implications of these results for the improvement of teaching practices in higher education.},

After analyzing the essential components of selfregulated learning, theoretical notions are presented on how skill in selfregulated learning could be developed in students. Next, two empirical studies are reported. In the first study, relationships between the components of selfregulated learning are investigated, as well as relationships between those components and variables such as educational experience, study results and age of students. The second study represents an attempt to help students to develop their skill in selfregulated learning. A Study Advisory Packet was developed intended to broaden their conceptions of learning, education and cooperation and to enlarge their metacognitive knowledge of studying. By means of an evaluative study the usefulness of this packet in the reality of studying at the Open university was researched. The results of the two studies indicate that (1) students' learning conceptions and orientations are closely linked to the study activities they employ, (2) students' learning styles are related to their educational experience and to their study results, but only in a small degree to their age, and (3) the Study Advisory Packet raised students' awareness of different ways of studying and contained practically useful suggestions for studying.},

@article{lonka_epistemologies_1996,

They were first asked to write down their own subjective definitions of learning. Scales to classify the answers were adopted from Lonka et al. (1990). Second, subjects were given a comprehension monitoring probe adopted from Ryan (1984). Responses were analysed to determine the specific comprehension criteria the student employed. Third, students rated a set of 71 statements concerning learning styles, regulation of learning, and conceptions of learning (Entwistle \& Ramsden, 1983; Vermunt \& van Rijswijk, 1988). Embedded in the last set of statements were seven items that were used to classify students as dualists or relativists (Perry, 1968; Ryan, 1984).It was found that constructivist conceptions of learning were the most typical of (advanced) psychology students, whereas learning was more often seen as intake of knowledge by the medical students. Highest dualism scores were obtained by the first year students, especially medical students. In general, dualists were more likely to report knowledge comprehension criteria to test their understanding than were relativists, and dualists' conceptions of learning were also more passive. Four principal components were identified that reflected qualitatively different approaches to learning and knowledge: externally regulated and reproduction-directed learning ({PC}1), self-regulated, meaning-directed, and goal-oriented learning ({PC}2), constructivist epistemology ({PC}3), and active professional orientation ({PC}4). Medical students scored higher on variables related to {PC}1 and {PC}4, whereas psychology students scored higher on scales associated with {PC}2 and {PC}3.},

@article{albirini_aspects_2014,
	abstract = {The nature and extent of the impact of language transfer in majority--minority language contexts have been widely debated in both second- and heritage-language acquisition. This study examines four linguistic areas in three oral narratives collected from Egyptian and Palestinian heritage speakers in the United States (namely, plural and dual morphology, possessive constructions, and restrictive relative clauses), with a special focus on how the second language (English) influences the structure and use of these areas in connected discourse. In addition, the study examines the relationship between second-language transfer and the incompleteness and attrition of heritage Arabic. The findings show that heritage speakers have various gaps in their knowledge of the examined areas, particularly in forms and patterns that diverge from their counterparts in their dominant L2. The results also suggest that transfer effects are restricted to specific forms that are marked (e.g. broken plurals), infrequent (duals), or characterized by processing difficulty (as seems to be the case with the dependencies in the relative clauses). Moreover, transfer effects are intimately related to both the attrition and incomplete acquisition of the speakers' knowledge of the four areas under study. The implications of the study for heritage language research are discussed.},

@article{dank_resolving_2015,
	abstract = {The present research investigated the attraction phenomenon, which commonly occurs in the domain of production but is also apparent in comprehension. It particularly focused on its accessibility to conceptual influence, in analogy to previous findings in production in Hebrew (Deutsch and Dank, J Mem Lang, 60:112--143, 2009). The experiments made use of the contrast between grammatical and natural gender in Hebrew, using complex subject noun phrases containing head nouns and prepositional phrases with local nouns. Noun phrases were manipulated to produce (a) matches and mismatches in grammatical gender between heads and local nouns; and (b) inanimate nouns and animate nouns with natural gender that served either as head or as local nouns. These noun phrases were the subjects of sentences that ended with predicates agreeing in gender with the head noun, with the local noun, or both. The ungrammatical sentences were those in which the gender of the predicate and the head noun did not match. To assess the impact of conflicts in grammatical and natural gender on the time course of reading, participants' eye movements were monitored. The results revealed clear disruptions in reading the predicate due to grammatical-gender mismatches with head and local nouns, in analogy to attraction in production. When the head nouns conveyed natural gender these effects were amplified, but variations in the natural gender of local nouns had negligible consequences. The results imply that comprehension and production are similarly sensitive to the control of grammatical agreement by grammatical and natural gender in subject noun phrases.},

@article{barr_random_2013,
	abstract = {Linear mixed-effects models ({LMEMs}) have become increasingly prominent in psycholinguistics and related areas. However, many researchers do not seem to appreciate how random effects structures affect the generalizability of an analysis. Here, we argue that researchers using {LMEMs} for confirmatory hypothesis testing should minimally adhere to the standards that have been in place for many decades. Through theoretical arguments and Monte Carlo simulation, we show that {LMEMs} generalize best when they include the maximal random effects structure justified by the design. The generalization performance of {LMEMs} including data-driven random effects structures strongly depends upon modeling criteria and sample size, yielding reasonable results on moderately-sized samples when conservative criteria are used, but with little or no power advantage over maximal models. Finally, random-intercepts-only {LMEMs} used on within-subjects and/or within-items data from populations where subjects and/or items vary in their sensitivity to experimental manipulations always generalize worse than separate F1 and F2 tests, and in many cases, even worse than F1 alone. Maximal {LMEMs} should be the `gold standard' for confirmatory hypothesis testing in psycholinguistics and beyond.},

@article{abuelhija_new_2014,
	abstract = {This paper is set within the context of {ElectronicAmiyyas}({EA}) written dialects in Facebook used by youth in the Arab World. In recent years, electronic writings have begun to replace print writing in many circumstances. Similar to the printing press, this new technology has also influenced the written colloquial forms of languages, since youngsters all over the world are formulating and devising new conventions for writing their indigenous spoken languages electronically. This linguistic development is now occurring in many languages in the world, and Arabic is just one example. Chinese youngsters, for example, are also deviating from the standard Chinese writing system by mixing spoken and written language features in order to facilitate the written use of oral dialects on the Internet. In Japan, young Japanese employ colloquial language online, for example, by using eccentric spelling which reproduces actual articulation in the typed message. This pattern of electronic writings is particularly salient in diglossic languages, such as Arabic, Persian and several languages of the Indian subcontinent such as Tamil, Sinhala, Telugu and Bengali. In such cases, the invention of a new writing system for the spoken language might endanger the formal written language. In this research, I describe the development of new systems for writing colloquial Arabic dialects. I am studying the consonantal system of {ElectronicAmiyyain} several countries in the Arab World. This is the first empirical study of this kind. The purpose of the study is to examine the differences in this system amongst the different users in different countries and to investigate any occurring standardisations.},

At the end of a parent-child play session, an assistant entered the playroom with a gift to elicit routines from the children. Spontaneous production of the three routines was low, with thank you the most infrequent. Parents actively prompted their children to produce routines, however, and children usually complied. Further, parents themselves used the routines, with more mothers than fathers saying thank you and goodbye to the assistant. Results were discussed in relation to the role of parents in linguistic socialization and to the importance of routines in social interaction. (Routines; politeness formulas; linguistic socialization; parental teaching; mother-father differences; sex role socialization)},

Examination of foundational issues, including definitions and operationalization of the concept of formula in pragmatics, shows the way in which pragmatics understands formulaic language and what it contributes to the study of formulaic language, namely, a strong sense of social contract. Recurrent themes in contemporary investigations include how formulas are used in general and in specific contexts, determining how extensive the use of formulas is, attitudes toward formulas, acquisition of formulas in second language (L2) pragmatics, and formulas in pragmatics pedagogy. The third section reviews pragmatic research according to language community, defined for the purposes of this review as first language (L1; native-speaker communities), L2, cross-cultural comparisons, indigenized varieties, and lingua franca communities. The investigation of formula use by different communities addresses questions of the particular and the universal in formula use and the importance of community and community membership.},

	abstract = {Currently, production and comprehension are regarded as quite distinct in accounts of language processing. In rejecting this dichotomy, we instead assert that producing and understanding are interwoven, and that this interweaving is what enables people to predict themselves and each other. We start by noting that production and comprehension are forms of action and action perception. We then consider the evidence for interweaving in action, action perception, and joint action, and explain such evidence in terms of prediction. Specifically, we assume that actors construct forward models of their actions before they execute those actions, and that perceivers of others' actions covertly imitate those actions, then construct forward models of those actions. We use these accounts of action, action perception, and joint action to develop accounts of production, comprehension, and interactive language. Importantly, they incorporate well-defined levels of linguistic representation (such as semantics, syntax, and phonology). We show (a) how speakers and comprehenders use covert imitation and forward modeling to make predictions at these levels of representation, (b) how they interweave production and comprehension processes, and (c) how they use these predictions to monitor the upcoming utterances. We show how these accounts explain a range of behavioral and neuroscientific data on language processing and discuss some of the implications of our proposal.},

@article{pickering_people_2006,
	abstract = {We present the case that language comprehension involves making simultaneous predictions at different linguistic levels and that these predictions are generated by the language production system. Recent research suggests that ease of comprehending predictable elements is due to prediction rather than facilitated integration, and that comprehension is accompanied by covert imitation. We argue that comprehenders use prediction and imitation to construct an `emulator', using the production system, and combine predictions with the input dynamically. Such a process helps to explain the rapidity of comprehension and the robust interpretation of ambiguous or noisy input. This framework is in line with a general trend in cognitive science to incorporate action systems into perceptual systems and has broad implications for understanding the links between language production and comprehension.},

Seventy-five Arabic native speakers read fully pointed, unpointed and pseudowords lists of Arabic and silent reading comprehension of pointed and unpointed paragraphs were tested. Reading speed and accuracy measures revealed a slowest and less accurate in reading pseudowords, and fastest and most accurate in reading unpointed words with pointed word naming speed and accuracy in between. Subjects who were fast and accurate in reading isolated words were also fast and accurate in reading all varieties of printed words. Pearson correlation procedures indicated that silent reading comprehension of pointed and unpointed Arabic texts was uncorrelated with either oral reading speed or accuracy.

Arabic orthography is considered deep if it is not vowelized but shallow if it is vowelized. The aim of this study was to examine the relationships among reading ability, phonological, semantic, orthographic and syntactic skills in Arabic. The participants were 143 Arab children, aged 8‐11, in Arab villages of central Israel. They were administered working memory, visual, oral close, phonological, word recognition, spelling, orthographic, and word attack tests. The results showed that word recognition test was highly correlated with phonological skills, semantic processing, syntactic knowledge and short‐term memory. Poor readers showed a significant lag in the development of these skills, the problems being most significant at phonological and semantic levels and less so at the visual levels. The similarities and differences between the acquisition of reading skills in Arabic and English are discussed.},

@article{kass_bayes_1995,
	abstract = {In a 1935 paper and in his book Theory of Probability, Jeffreys developed a methodology for quantifying the evidence in favor of a scientific theory. The centerpiece was a number, now called the Bayes factor, which is the posterior odds of the null hypothesis when the prior probability on the null is one-half. Although there has been much discussion of Bayesian hypothesis testing in the context of criticism of P-values, less attention has been given to the Bayes factor as a practical tool of applied statistics. In this article we review and discuss the uses of Bayes factors in the context of five scientific applications in genetics, sports, ecology, sociology, and psychology. We emphasize the following points: * From Jeffreys' Bayesian viewpoint, the purpose of hypothesis testing is to evaluate the evidence in favor of a scientific theory. * Bayes factors offer a way of evaluating evidence in favor of a null hypothesis. * Bayes factors provide a way of incorporating external information into the evaluation of evidence about a hypothesis. * Bayes factors are very general and do not require alternative models to be nested. * Several techniques are available for computing Bayes factors, including asymptotic approximations that are easy to compute using the output from standard packages that maximize likelihoods. * In ``nonstandard'' statistical models that do not satisfy common regularity conditions, it can be technically simpler to calculate Bayes factors than to derive non-Bayesian significance tests. * The Schwarz criterion (or {BIC}) gives a rough approximation to the logarithm of the Bayes factor, which is easy to use and does not require evaluation of prior distributions. * When one is interested in estimation or prediction, Bayes factors may be converted to weights to be attached to various models so that a composite estimate or prediction may be obtained that takes account of structural or model uncertainty. * Algorithms have been proposed that allow model uncertainty to be taken into account when the class of models initially considered is very large. * Bayes factors are useful for guiding an evolutionary model-building process. * It is important, and feasible, to assess the sensitivity of conclusions to the prior distributions used.},

@article{schlund_form_2014,
	abstract = {This paper focuses on the notion of politeness formulae in linguistic politeness research. It argues that the formal make-up of politeness formulae is crucially motivated by their function. The major claim of this paper is thus that there is a link between form and function of expressions of linguistic politeness. The usefulness of this account will be illustrated by the analysis of empirical data from Slavic languages and German. Reference to Roman Jakobson's markedness theory will show that the choice of linguistic means is not only dependent on concrete contexts (as is usually claimed in linguistic politeness theory) but also motivated by the language system itself.},

@article{terkourafi_beyond_2005,
	abstract = {Politeness research to date has generally adopted one of two views: the ``traditional'' view based on the dual premises of Grice's Co-operative Principle and speech act theory (Lakoff 1973, Brown and Levinson 1987 [1978], Leech 1983), or the ``post-modern'' view, which rejects these premises and substitutes them by an emphasis on participants' own perceptions of politeness (politeness1) and on the discursive struggle over politeness (Eelen 2001, Mills 2003, Watts 2003). Contrasting these two views, this article considers not only their points of disagreement, but, crucially, points where the two views coincide, bringing to light their common underlying assumptions. It then goes on to show how, departing from these common assumptions, a third direction for politeness studies, the ``frame-based'' view, is possible. Following an outline of the frame-based view, it is suggested that this fits in with the traditional and the post-modern views in a three-layered schema addressing politeness phenomena at different levels of granularity.},

@article{dussias_when_2013,
	abstract = {In a recent study, Lew-Williams and Fernald (2007) showed that native Spanish speakers use grammatical gender
                    information encoded in Spanish articles to facilitate the processing of upcoming
                    nouns. In this article, we report the results of a study investigating whether
                    grammatical gender facilitates noun recognition during second language (L2)
                    processing. Sixteen monolingual Spanish participants (control group) and 18
                    English-speaking learners of Spanish (evenly divided into high and low Spanish
                    proficiency) saw two-picture visual scenes in which items matched or did not
                    match in gender. Participants' eye movements were recorded while they
                    listened to 28 sentences in which masculine and feminine target items were
                    preceded by an article that agreed in gender with the two pictures or agreed
                    only with one of the pictures. An additional group of 15 Italian learners of
                    Spanish was tested to examine whether the presence of gender in the first
                    language (L1) modulates the degree to which gender is used during L2 processing.
                    Data were analyzed by comparing the proportion of eye fixations on the objects
                    in each condition. Monolingual Spanish speakers looked sooner at the referent on
                    different-gender trials than on same-gender trials, replicating results reported
                    in past literature. Italian-Spanish bilinguals exhibited a gender anticipatory
                    effect, but only for the feminine condition. For the masculine condition,
                    participants waited to hear the noun before identifying the referent. Like the
                    Spanish monolinguals, the highly proficient English-Spanish speakers showed
                    evidence of using gender information during online processing, whereas the less
                    proficient learners did not. The results suggest that both proficiency in the L2
                    and similarities between the L1 and the L2 modulate the usefulness of
                    morphosyntactic information during speech processing.},

	abstract = {Orthographic mapping ({OM}) involves the formation of letter-sound connections to bond the spellings, pronunciations, and meanings of specific words in memory. It explains how children learn to read words by sight, to spell words from memory, and to acquire vocabulary words from print. This development is portrayed by Ehri (2005a) as a sequence of overlapping phases, each characterized by the predominant type of connection linking spellings of words to their pronunciations in memory. During development, the connections improve in quality and word-learning value, from visual nonalphabetic, to partial alphabetic, to full grapho-phonemic, to consolidated grapho-syllabic and grapho-morphemic. {OM} is enabled by phonemic awareness and grapheme-phoneme knowledge. Recent findings indicate that {OM} to support sight word reading is facilitated when beginners are taught about articulatory features of phonemes and when grapheme-phoneme relations are taught with letter-embedded picture mnemonics. Vocabulary learning is facilitated when spellings accompany pronunciations and meanings of new words to activate {OM}. Teaching students the strategy of pronouncing novel words aloud as they read text silently activates {OM} and helps them build their vocabularies. Because spelling-sound connections are retained in memory, they impact the processing of phonological constituents and phonological memory for words.},

@incollection{janda_inflectional_2010,
	abstract = {In terms of both form and meaning, inflectional morphology occupies an unusual position in language, as it teeters on the margins between lexicon and syntax in apparent defiance of definition. In most languages, inflectional morphology marks relations such as person, number, case, gender, possession, tense, aspect, and mood, serving as an essential grammatical glue holding the relationships in constructions together. Yet in some languages, inflectional morphology is minimal or may not exist at all. From the perspective of cognitive linguistics, inflectional morphology presents a rich array of opportunities to apply and test core concepts, particularly those involving category structure (radial categories, prototypicality, polysemy), the grounding and organization of categories (embodiment, basic-level concepts, ``ception,'' construal), and the means of extension and elaboration of categories (metaphor, metonymy). This article assumes that there are three kinds of morphemes: lexical, derivational, and inflectional. The behavior of these three types of morphemes can best be understood within the context of constructions. The article focuses on the highly inflected Slavic languages to illustrate the discussions.},

Although there has been interest in the nature of intermediate varieties of the Arabic language, i.e. those involving some mix of Classical Arabic ({CA}), Modern Standard Arabic ({MSA}), and national dialects, research on these varieties has generally been limited to describing the linguistic features of a third language or middle varieties. Absent, however, has been any effort to analyze the mix as switching between {CA}/{MSA} and the dialect or to relate issues of variation to theoretical models of switching. In this paper, I argue that what is called third language (or middle varieties) are in fact diglossie switching, and that there is no variety conventionalized as third language. Rather, what is being conventionalized are patterns of switching between two varieties with the dialect as the matrix variety into which constituents (i.e. content morphemes) from {CA}/{MSA} are embedded. The data examined in light of the {MLF} model demonstrate that the mix of the two varieties is governed by structural constraints and hence the switching patterns are systematic and predictable.},

@article{schiffman_standardization_1998,
	abstract = {{ABSTRACT}
            The Tamil language has had its current standard written form since the 13th century; but because of increasing diglossia, spoken Tamil dialects have now diverged so radically from earlier norms, including the written standard ({LT}, or Literary Tamil) that no spoken dialect, regional or social, can function as the koin{\'e} or lingua franca. Because {LT} is never used for authentic informal oral communication between live speakers, there has always been a need for some sort of spoken ``standard'' koin{\'e} for inter-dialect communication. Aside from interpersonal communication, one hears this inter-dialect koin{\'e} most clearly in the so-called ``social''film, which arose out of its antecedent, the popular or ``social'' drama. Conversational portions of novels and short stories also exhibit spoken forms, though not always as clearly ``phonetic'' as a phonetician might expect. The goal of this paper is to examine the concept of ``language standardization'' as it has been applied to other languages, focusing on the role of literacy and writing in this process; then to present evidence for, as well as the sources of, koin{\ae}ization of "Standard Spoken Tamil"; and then to determine whether {SST} is in fact an emergent standard, given the challenges of literacy and writing.

Because native speakers of Arabic first learn to read in Modern Standard Arabic ({MSA}), a language structurally distinct from the local form of the language they grow up speaking, it was hypothesized that the linguistic differences between the two varieties, the so-called diglossic variables, would interfere with the acquisition of basic reading processes in {MSA}. Two diglossic variables were examined: phoneme and word syllabic structure. The children's phoneme isolation and pseudoword decoding skills were tested. The results showed that both diglossic variables interfered with the children's performance of both tasks in both grades. The findings support the role of linguistic distance in the acquisition of basic reading processes in a diglossic context.},

Both variables are important factors in determining the optimal use of space in a line of text, and fonts differ widely in how they employ these spaces. Prior research suggests that the proximity of flanking letters influences the identification of a central letter via lateral inhibition or crowding. If so, decrements in intraword spacing may produce inhibition in word processing. Still other research suggests that increases in intraword spacing can disrupt the integrity of word units. In English, interword spacing has a large influence on word segmentation and is important for saccade target selection. The results indicate an interplay between intra- and interword spacing that influences a font's readability. Additionally, these studies highlight the importance of word segmentation processes and have implications for the nature of lexical processing (serial vs. parallel).},

	abstract = {Distribution of Disney films and {TV} products in the Arab world has recently undergone a radical change: since the signing of a large-scale agreement between Al Jazeera and Disney, in 2013, most films and {TV} series are being dubbed, or redubbed, in Modern Standard Arabic. Contrary to the long-standing tradition of dubbing Disney productions using the Egyptian vernacular variety of Arabic, the eminently written, formal language used for administration and classical education has been introduced as a vehicle for animation dialogue. And not without consistent semantic manipulation.  This article seeks to contextualize this recent shift in dubbing animation in the Arab world, with a view to unveiling its underlying dynamics. The role played by Al Jazeera in reshaping media communication and translation across the Arab world and beyond is also considered, in an attempt to grasp the social, political and ultimately ideological implications of its strategies, as well as its power in significantly orienting traditionally imperialist, Western colossi like Disney. A comparative analysis of the original English {TV} series Aladdin, its Egyptian dubbed version and {MSA} redubbing follows, providing evidence for this new trend in audiovisual translation aimed at Arabic speakers the world over.},

Stylistic or intraspeaker variation derives from and mirrors interspeaker variation. Style is essentially speakers' response to their audience. In audience design, speakers accommodate primarily to their addressee. Third persons -- auditors and overhearers -- affect style to a lesser but regular degree. Audience design also accounts for bilingual or bidialectal code choices. Nonaudience factors like topic and setting derive their effect by association with addressee types. These style shifts are mainly responsive -- caused by a situational change. Speakers can also use style as initiative, to redefine the existing situation. Initiative style is primarily referee design: divergence from the addressee and towards an absent reference group. Referee design is especially prevalent in mass communication.

	abstract = {Abstract
            One of the most popular and influential theories of word processing, dual-route theory, proposes that there are two functionally independent means of processing words, one involving access to lexical knowledge and the other involving nonlexical grapheme-to-phoneme conversion. Three topics germane to this theory are the processing of nonwords, spelling regularity effects, and the manner in which reading may be impaired following selective damage to either route. This paper evaluates evidence on these topics, and in each case the claims of the theory for an independent nonlexical processing route are called into question. This conclusion is further supported by a discussion of the linguistic constraints that limit any nonlexical grapheme---phoneme conversion process. Some alternative approaches to visual word processing, which share the assumption that lexical knowledge can guide the assembly of phonological information, are discussed. It is argued that these approaches should direct future research.},

In this study we test the hypothesis that readers of Arabic do not parse sentences for case and that orthographically marked case can therefore be removed with no effect on reading. Twenty-nine participants read sentences in which one of the two most frequent types of orthographically marke case was either retained or omitted, while their eye-movements were monitored. The removal of case marking from subjects in the sound masculine plural declension (changing the suffix ‑{\=u}n ـون to ‑{\=\i}n ـين) had no negative effect on gaze duration, regressions out, or go-past time. The removal of case marking form direct objects in the triptote declension (omitting the suffix -an ـاً) did however resulted in an increase in these measures. These results indicate that only some forms of case marking are required in the grammar used by readers for parsing written text.},

This has certainly been the case in the field of language policy and planning ({LPP}), which has incorporated new ways of thinking about language, society, and cognition, as evidenced by the published research in journals and books. This chapter considers the ways in which views on the nature of language, language ideologies, and language and identity have fundamentally altered the research agendas and foci in the field of {LPP} over the past several decades. It examines how these newer ways of understanding language in society have been applied to English-speaking countries, particularly with reference to North America.},

It will then review ongoing attempts to resolve these problems (i.e. to provide Arabic corpora that can ``do what English corpora can do''). A case will then be made for the need for a very large, non-lemmatized corpus of Arabic until such time as the massive resources needed to create a large lemmatized corpus become available in a non-politicized/non-ideological manner. {arabiCorpus}.byu.edu is one attempt to provide this clearly less than adequate, temporary solution.

An overview of {arabiCorpus} will be given that will highlight both what it does well and what it does poorly. The nuts and bolts behind the `magic' will be explained, and then several case studies will be examined which will demonstrate that although this corpus clearly cannot `do' what English corpora routinely do, creative solutions exist that allow one in many cases to approximate those results, and which provide data for uses in lexicography, Arabic language teaching and Arabic Linguistics that would have been difficult or impossible to obtain before the availability of such online corpora.},

@article{albirini_why_2019,
	abstract = {, Abstract:, One of the major claims in Arabic linguistic research is that Standard Arabic ({SA}) is a second language for native speakers of Arabic simply because it is not acquired naturally from parents. This study examines this claim by investigating whether Arabic speakers' proficiency in {SA} converges with their proficiency in Colloquial Arabic ({CA}) or English. Sixteen native Arabic speakers completed three oral production tasks and three written production tasks. These speakers were compared to ten native English speakers with respect to English proficiency. The findings revealed that the Arabic speakers performed significantly worse on the {SA} oral task than on the {CA} oral task, but the opposite was true on the writing task. Their overall proficiencies in {SA} and {CA} were not significantly different. However, they performed significantly worse on English than on {SA} and {CA} and worse than the native English speakers. Overall, the findings suggest that the Arabic native speakers' proficiency in {SA} is closer to their proficiency in {CA} (their L1) than their proficiency in English (their Ln).},

@article{daniels_fundamentals_1990,
	abstract = {A very influential suggestion in I. J. Gelb's Study of Writing concerns the nature of the West Semitic scripts. Usually thitherto called "alphabets," the Hebrew, Phoenician, etc., scripts are for Gelb "syllabaries" whose characters have values like bx; a corollary is that the Ethiopian script is not a syllabary but an alphabet. While this notion has been widely adopted, it remains counter-intuitive. A recent suggestion of P. Swiggers-to distinguish between "denoting" and "standing for" a syllable-helps to clarify Gelb's thinking but does not alleviate the terminological difficulties. A characteristic of Gelb's work in many fields may account for his view of the evolution of writing systems and seems to have led to the mischaracterization of some scripts noted by previous commentators. Here a typology of scripts is proposed that recognizes both a new type intermediate between syllabary and alphabet and a fundamental distinction between two kinds of syllabary.},

	abstract = {{AbstractCurrent} reading models were largely designed to explain findings from experiments of the reading of English and other European languages (Reichle, 2020, Computational models of reading: A handbook). Recent evidence from studies of other languages and writing systems (e.g., Chinese) has demonstrated the need to critically evaluate the assumptions of these models, and whether they are sufficient to explain the full range of findings related to reading, as required, for example, to understand the universal and specific cognitive principles that support reading. In this article, we review the recent behavioural and cognitive-neuroscience research on the reading of Arabic, a world language that until recently has received scant attention despite the fact that its writing system poses fundamental challenges for current models of reading. We also highlight the points of convergence and difference between what has been learned about the reading of Arabic and the reading of another, more widely studied Semitic language, Hebrew. We then discuss the theoretical implications of these findings for existing models of reading.},

@article{kugel_how_1993,
	abstract = {Like the learning abilities of their students, the teaching abilities of college professors seem to develop in stages. In this paper I want to offer an account of how this development sometimes, and perhaps often, proceeds. Typically, when they begin their teaching careers, professors focus their concern primarily on their own role in the classroom (stage 1: self). When they have mastered this role, at least to their own satisfaction, the focus of their concern shifts, first to their understanding of the subject matter they teach (stage 2: subject) and then to their students' ability to absorb what they have been taught (stage 3: student). With this last shift comes a more general shift of focus from teaching to learning, that begins, in stage 3, with a focus on helping their students become more absorbent (stage 3: student as receptive). Concern then typically shifts to helping students learn to use what they have been taught (stage 4: student as active) and then to helping them to learn on their own (stage 5: student as independent). My account of this development is based on the informal observation of a few cases and it suggests a framework for thinking about the development of professors as teachers. With further work, it might lead to theories that will describe what does happen and predict what will happen.},

He has contributed articles to both English and Kiswahili journals, and is currently writing two book chapters on stylistics and identity, and on language and ethnicity in Africa. This paper examines language policy in Kenya from colonialism to date, with a particular focus on education. The colonial period is appraised with regard to pre and post Second World War, while the independence era is analysed as pertains the government's position and the linguistic realities among lay people. Considering that in most cases lay Kenyans use language in ways that are incongruent to the official policy, the paper raises the argument that this is both mediation and contestation with linguistic hegemony. Results of an empirical study conducted in rural and urban centres in Kenya are used to validate the argument. Though the masses have shown no plan or organisation in their reaction to linguistic hegemony, the paper argues that they have mediated and contested it through abrogation of English and the assertion of African languages, appropriation of both English and Kiswahili to the people's circumstances, and through the evolution of patois like Sheng and Engsh. While both mediation and contestation are frowned upon by sticklers to the standard languages, the paper prospects that ultimately they are bound to impact substantially on the language situation and policy in the country.},

@article{azmi_survey_2015,
	abstract = {Abstract
            In Modern Standard Arabic texts are typically written without diacritical markings. The diacritics are important to clarify the sense and meaning of words. Lack of these markings may lead to ambiguity even for the natives. Often the natives successfully disambiguate the meaning through the context; however, many Arabic applications, such as machine translation, text-to-speech, and information retrieval, are vulnerable due to lack of diacritics. The process of automatically restoring diacritical marks is called diacritization or diacritic restoration. In this paper we discuss the properties of the Arabic language and the issues that are related to the lack of the diacritical marking. It will be followed by a survey of the recent algorithms that were developed to solve the diacritization problem. We also look into the future trend for researchers working in this area.},

@article{eviatar_speed_2019,
	abstract = {We tested the effects of orthography on text reading by comparing reading measures in Arabic and Hebrew-speaking adults. The languages are typologically very similar, but use different orthographies. We measured naming speed of single letters, words and nonwords, and visual processing. Arabic-speakers also performed some of the tasks in Hebrew. We measured silent and oral reading speed of simpler and complex texts and their relationships with component abilities. Results show that Arabic-speakers read complex texts in Arabic more slowly than Hebrew-speakers read in Hebrew. Arabic-speakers read texts in Hebrew more slowly than in Arabic, even though they performed the letter naming and visual tasks equivalently in the two languages. For both groups, the best predictor of oral reading speed is speed of reading single words, with speed of letter naming adding to the prediction in Hebrew, but not in Arabic. No variable had a significant contribution to the prediction of speed of silent reading. The results suggest that even though lower level processes such as letter and word identification may be simpler to perform in Hebrew than in Arabic, higher level processes required to comprehend a complex text, are always faster in the first language of the participants. Both the characteristics of the text, its structural and semantic complexity, and the characteristics of the orthography play roles in the quality of reading. Relationships between the top-down and bottom-up components of reading are dynamic, and specific to orthographic factors and the sociolinguistic environment of the readers (e.g., the diglossia of Arabic).},

@incollection{albatal_dialect_2018,
	abstract = {Arabic is a diglossic language: What is written is different from what is spoken. For decades, students have learned written Arabic first and then spoken but this does not reflect the sociolinguistic reality of the language nor does it give students what they need to communicate. Teachers of Arabic have struggled to teach communicative skills. With the introduction of Al-Kitaab Third Edition, this method had to be established. Though there has been much discussion about "integrating Arabic, " little research or evidence has been presented about it. In this volume, Al-Batal gathers scholars who are using this method with success to present research that the method works. They will address curricular models, students' measured outcomes (with copious examples), and attitudes of students and teachers (which often change) using this methodology. Contributors are a mix of well-known and young scholars, bringing fresh voices into this discussion and making this method more established and less "experimental." Additional data will be provided on the {GU} Press website. Data include, tables/figures, audio, and video recordings of students showing the proposed method and outcomes from the method discussed. References to these resources will be made in the book.},

@article{ziegler_reading_2005,
	abstract = {The development of reading depends on phonological awareness across all languages so far studied. Languages vary in the consistency with which phonology is represented in orthography. This results in developmental differences in the grain size of lexical representations and accompanying differences in developmental reading strategies and the manifestation of dyslexia across orthographies. Differences in lexical representations and reading across languages leave developmental "footprints" in the adult lexicon. The lexical organization and processing strategies that are characteristic of skilled reading in different orthographies are affected by different developmental constraints in different writing systems. The authors develop a novel theoretical framework to explain these cross-language data, which they label a psycholinguistic grain size theory of reading and its development.

@article{suleiman_arabic_2014,
	abstract = {The essay explores Arab(ic) language anxiety in modern discourse on the language. The conceptual starting point is the distinction between the instrumental and symbolic roles of language in society. The essay further distinguishes between language fears and language anxieties, linking the former to the instrumental role of the language and anxiety proper to its symbolic role. These distinctions are further related to corpus planning and status planning in language policy research to create a web of interrelated concepts that, while recognized as conceptually autonomous, are difficult to sharply separate from each other in practice. To do this, the essay identifies a number of domains from which data on language anxiety can be culled and the terms and metaphorics that are employed in discussing these data in a number of domains. The essay makes two further observations. First, language anxiety is a universal phenomenon. To make this point, the essay refers to language anxiety in English and French. Second, recent language-teaching reforms in the Arabic-speaking world have not succeeded partly because they offer instrumental, corpus-based solutions to symbolic and status-linked concerns.},

	abstract = {This study aimed at assessing the effects of letters' connectivity in Arabic on visual word recognition. For this purpose, reaction times ({RTs}) and accuracy scores were collected from ninety-third, sixth and ninth grade native Arabic speakers during a lexical decision task, using fully connected (Cw), partially connected ({PCw}) and nonconnected ({NCw}) Arabic words and pseudowords. Effects of grade on word recognition (in {RTs} and accuracy) and word superiority were predicted to occur. Also, in the third grade, recognition of {NCw} was predicted to be faster and more accurate than recognition of Cw, because in previous studies {NCw} were assumed to be visually less complex. In sixth and ninth grades, due to the frequent exposure to connected forms, the recognition of Cw was predicted to be as fast as or faster and more accurate than {NCw}. The findings largely supported the first and the second hypotheses. As for the third graders, a mixed pattern was obtained, suggesting that the participants were probably in a transitional phase. The results from sixth graders clearly showed that {NCw} yielded the slowest response times and the lowest accuracy scores across connectivity conditions. Finally, for ninth graders, the absence of connectivity effects on the speed of processing was attributed to the use of very frequent and highly automatized words.},

The findings were considered controversial. Such a determination can have important implications for both local and national educational policies seeking the improvement of reading skills and comprehension among Arabic readers of all ages. In this study, 60 native Arabic speakers,  12 years old were sampled from school in northern Israel. They were  divided into two equal groups of 30 normal and 30 poor readers, based on their average grade point average in the Arabic Language subject. The results indicated that the vocalization of Arabic texts significantly improved both reading accuracy and comprehension among all participants, whether normal or weaker readers. Further, despite the very noticeable difference between reading abilities among the two groups (regular and weak readers) at the outset, on the average we found that the addition of short vowels helped both groups acquire basic reading skills. The findings indicated that the use of vocalized texts helps readers achieve higher reading comprehension levels among all types of readers.},

Colleen Cotter goes behind the scenes, revealing how language is chosen and shaped by news staff into the stories we read and hear. Tracing news stories from start to finish, she shows how the actions of journalists and editors - and the limitations of news writing formulas - may distort a story that was prepared with the most determined effort to be fair and accurate. Using insights from both linguistics and journalism, News Talk is a remarkable picture of a hidden world and its working practices on both sides of the Atlantic. It will interest those involved in language study, media and communication studies and those who want to understand how media shape our language and our view of the world.},

@article{coltheart_drc_2001,
	abstract = {This article describes the Dual Route Cascaded ({DRC}) model, a computational model of visual word recognition and reading aloud. The {DRC} is a computational realization of the dual-route theory of reading, and is the only computational model of reading that can perform the 2 tasks most commonly used to study reading: lexical decision and reading aloud. For both tasks, the authors show that a wide variety of variables that influence human latencies influence the {DRC} model's latencies in exactly the same way. The {DRC} model simulates a number of such effects that other computational models of reading do not, but there appear to be no effects that any other current computational model of reading can simulate but that the {DRC} model cannot. The authors conclude that the {DRC} model is the most successful of the existing computational models of reading. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2016 {APA}, all rights reserved)},

The students produce some kind of text, often a draft, and share it with their supervisor who is expected to assess it. But how is feedback best given? What kind of feedback might be productive for the student and what might not? Since research supervision most often takes place behind closed doors, as private communication between student and supervisor, there has not been much sharing and exchange of methods and experience between and among supervisors. Nowadays, however, supervisors seem keen to learn more about how to deal with this important task. And students, rather than leaving it all to the supervisor's judgement, seem eager to. In this article we offer practical advice for the consideration of supervisors as well as students. It is based partly on research and partly on information shared with us by our co-supervisors.},

@article{heath_proficiency_1990,
	abstract = {[The "proficiency" approach to language teaching has generated much discussion and not a little controversy among teachers of Arabic as a foreign language during the last decade. Rather than being evaluated on the basis of the rival claims of proponents or opponents, the movement must be viewed as part of a natural process towards functionality in language acquisition which has played a continuous role in the modern history of language instruction in this country. From this perspective, two questions must be raised. First, is the proficiency approach to teaching Arabic as now advocated, which generally has ignored teaching colloquial dialects as well as {MSA}, really functional enough to suit the true needs of our students? Second, is the debate concerning "proficiency" becoming so polarized as to make impossible real discussion of the issues?]},

Spoken Arabic is often stigmatized as a less prestigious variety of Arabic, even though it is the language of choice for day-to-day communication for native Arabic speakers. Knowledge of a spoken variety of Arabic is essential for students who hope to integrate into the general populace in the Arabic-speaking world. This paper argues that Arabic programs throughout the United States should integrate the teaching of Spoken Arabic into their curricula to accommodate student wants and needs.},

This proposal is designed to alleviate some of the problems currently faced by Arabic programs in preparing students for the complex sociolinguistic situation in the Arab world. According to the proposal, the program begins with the spoken dialect, which is used for informal speaking throughout the course, and gradually integrates {MSA} materials for listening and reading comprehension. A significant merit of this approach is that it takes advantage of the fact that colloquial Arabic and {MSA} are varieties of the same language which share a number of linguistic features.},

	abstract = {This article explores the microgenetic development of learners' understanding of sociolinguistic variation in French during an instructional conversation ({IC}) that followed a language analysis task in which learners attempted to formulate hypotheses about the nature of language variation. During the {IC}, the instructor led students toward a conceptual understanding of variation in French by providing appropriate graduated (i.e. from implicit or strategic to explicit) mediation that was sensitive to the class's zone of proximal development ({ZPD}). Teacher--student collaborative interaction within a group's {ZPD} has the potential to develop learners' conceptual understanding of variation, which can provide an important orienting basis for the development of their performance abilities. The transcript of the {IC} is analysed and discussed with regard to the amount and type(s) of mediation the instructor provides and opportunities for development created in this type of collaborative interaction.},

@report{goldenberg_instructional_1991,
	abstract = {Generations of educators have advocated a type of teaching that does more than impart knowledge and teach skills. Knowledge and skills are undoubtedly important, but true education requires far more. It requires helping students use their knowledge and skills to understand, appreciate, and grapple with important ideas as they develop a depth of understanding for a wide range of issues and questions. Yet teaching aimed at these important goals is largely absent from U.S. classrooms."Instructional conversations" ({ICs}) might be one way to achieve the ambitious but elusive goals long held by many thoughtful educators. {ICs} are discussion-based lessons geared toward creating opportunities for students' conceptual and linguistic development. They focus on an idea or a students. The teacher encourages expression of students' own ideas, builds upon information students provide and experiences they have had, and guides students to increasingly sophisticated levels of understanding. In contrast to more directive forms of instruction, which assume that what is to be learned by the students is already in the head of the teachers, {ICs} assume that students themselves play an important role in constructing new knowledge and in acquiring new understandings about the world.Conversations that instruct and stimulate thinking might be particularly important for language minority students, many of whom receive insufficient opportunities for conceptual and linguistic development at school. By providing students with opportunities to engage in interactions that promote analysis, reflection, and critical thinking, instructional conversations suggest a way to help redress the imbalance of a curriculum that is heavily weighted toward skills and knowledge acquisition.},

@inproceedings{baron_vard2_2008,
	abstract = {When applying corpus linguistic techniques to historical corpora, the corpus researcher should be cautious about the results obtained. Corpus annotation techniques such as part of speech tagging, trained for modern languages, are particularly vulnerable to inaccuracy due to vocabulary and grammatical shifts in language over time. Basic corpus retrieval techniques such as frequency profiling and concordancing will also be affected, in addition to the more sophisticated techniques such as keywords, n-grams, clusters and lexical bundles which rely on word frequencies for their calculations. In this paper, we highlight these problems with particular focus on Early Modern English corpora. We also present an overview of the {VARD} tool, our proposed solution to this problem, which facilitates pre-processing of historical corpus data by inserting modern equivalents alongside historical spelling variants. Recent improvements to the {VARD} tool include the incorporation of techniques used in modern spell checking software.},
